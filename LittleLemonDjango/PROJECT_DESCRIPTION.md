# Little Lemon Restaurant API - Project Description

## Overview

The Little Lemon Restaurant API is a comprehensive Django REST Framework-based backend system designed to power a modern restaurant management platform. This robust API serves as the backbone for managing restaurant operations, from menu browsing and order processing to user authentication and role-based access control.

## Core Functionality

The system implements a complete restaurant ecosystem with four distinct user roles:

**Customers** can register accounts, browse categorized menu items with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities, manage shopping carts, place orders, and track their order history. The API provides seamless pagination and search functionality to enhance the user experience.

**Delivery Crew** members have specialized access to view orders assigned to them and update delivery status, ensuring efficient order fulfillment and real-time tracking capabilities.

**Managers** possess elevated privileges to manage the entire menu system, including creating and updating menu items and categories. They can assign orders to delivery crew members and manage delivery personnel, providing operational oversight and workflow optimization.

**Administrators** have complete system control, managing user roles, overseeing all restaurant operations, and maintaining the platform's integrity through comprehensive user and content management capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

Built on Django 4.2.23 with Django REST Framework, the API leverages modern Python development practices using Pipenv for dependency management. The system employs token-based authentication through Djoser, ensuring secure API access while maintaining simplicity for client integration.

The database architecture features five core models: Categories for menu organization, MenuItems with pricing and featured status, Cart for temporary order management, Orders for transaction tracking, and OrderItems for detailed order composition. These models work together to create a normalized, efficient data structure that supports complex restaurant operations.

## Key Features

- **RESTful API Design**: Clean, intuitive endpoints following REST conventions
- **Role-Based Security**: Granular permissions ensuring appropriate access levels
- **Advanced Filtering**: Menu items can be filtered by category, price, and search terms
- **Pagination Support**: Efficient data handling for large menu catalogs
- **Cart Management**: Persistent shopping cart functionality with real-time price calculations
- **Order Processing**: Complete order lifecycle from placement to delivery
- **Admin Interface**: Django admin integration for backend management
- **CORS Configuration**: Ready for frontend integration across different domains

## Business Value

This API enables restaurants to digitize their operations completely, providing customers with a modern ordering experience while giving staff powerful tools for order management and delivery coordination. The flexible architecture supports scaling from single-location restaurants to multi-branch operations, making it an ideal foundation for restaurant technology modernization.

The system's modular design and comprehensive documentation ensure easy maintenance and future enhancements, while its adherence to industry standards guarantees compatibility with various frontend frameworks and mobile applications.
